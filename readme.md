#RECALL

Recall is an app developed by [Jack Franklin](http://twitter.com/Jack_Franklin) and designed by [Toby Howarth](http://twitter.com/TobyHowarth).

This app will shortly be entered into the [10K Apart](http://10k.aneventapart.com) competition. 

I've decided to put it on Github to let people have a look at the code and learn from it. Any questions, let me know!

If you fancy giving the game a try, you can [play it here](http://10k.jackfranklin.org)

#Current Status
Just sent it off for first attempt at submission. Finger's crossed!


#Technologies
All the JS for the app is written in CoffeeScript. If you want to have a play, be sure to edit `a.coffee`, not `a.js`, and get [CoffeeScript](http://jackfranklin.co.uk/blog/2011/09/javascript-coffeescript) installed.

The words are pulled in using the [Wordnik API](http://developer.wordnik.com/). You have to register a developer account, but it's free & instant. 

I used [Smaller App for Mac](http://smallerapp.com/) to minify the JS & CSS for me. It also minifies the HTML for you as well if you want, but it didn't really save anything. 

[Smush It!](http://www.smushit.com/ysmush.it/) was used to get some KB off the two images.
