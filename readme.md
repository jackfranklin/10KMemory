#RECALL

Recall is an app developed by [Jack Franklin](http://twitter.com/Jack_Franklin) and designed by [Toby Howarth](http://twitter.com/TobyHowarth).

This app will shortly be entered into the [10K Apart](http://10k.aneventapart.com) competition. 

I've decided to put it on Github to let people have a look at the code and learn from it. Any questions, let me know!

If you fancy giving the game a try, you can [play it here](http://10k.jackfranklin.org)

#Current Status
The code currently is messy & was just written to get a working app. I'm in the process of refactoring it all to tidy it up.
The site's "responsiveness" also needs some working on.

#Technologies
All the JS for the app is written in CoffeeScript. If you want to have a play, be sure to edit `a.coffee`, not `a.js`, and get [CoffeeScript](http://jackfranklin.co.uk/blog/2011/09/javascript-coffeescript) installed.

The words are pulled in using the [Wordnik API](http://developer.wordnik.com/). You have to register a developer account, but it's free & instant.
